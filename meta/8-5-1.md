The indicator shows the Kaitz index for the state of Berlin. Exact data for Treptow-KÃ¶penick are unfortunately not available. The Kaitz index indicates the ratio between the minimum wage (e.g. 1532 euros in 2018) and the average gross monthly earnings of full-time employees (e.g. 3700 euros in 2018). If it were 100%, exactly the minimum wage would be earned on average in the affected area. The Kaitz index is a measure of the potential impact of the minimum wage: the higher it is in a region, the greater the impact of the minimum wage there.
