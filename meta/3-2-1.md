In order to get an overall view of the environmental situation in Berlin, the state of Berlin has implemented an environmental justice monitoring. 
The environmental justice monitoring evaluates existing data of different core indicators (e.g. noise pollution and air pollution) and aggregates these data on a neighborhood level, respectively on a total of 447 so called planning areas (PLR), whereas Treptow-Köpenick is divided into 34 planning areas. <br>
The data basis for the noise pollution of the planning areas (PLRs) was the Strategic Noise Map 2012 with the LDEN levels (noise index day-evening-night) for road, rail and air traffic noise. Since the areas have different densities, the traffic noise exposure per capita was determined and monetized at external noise costs per person. The noise costs financially represent the loss of benefit that residents experience. The cost rates for this were provided by the Methodology Convention 2.0 of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt).  <br> According to these noise costs per capita, the 447 PLRs were sorted in ascending order and divided into three categories: The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact, the top 20 percent high impact, and all others medium impact.
