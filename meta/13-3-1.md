The indicator shows the CO2 emissions of the Treptow-Köpenick district. <br>
The basis for the calculation is the energy and CO₂ balance (polluter balance) of the city of Berlin. The per capita emissions for each year were multiplied by Treptow-Köpenick's population.
The data can thus only show an approximate picture, as they are not based on actual energy consumption in Treptow-Köpenick. In addition, the polluter balance does not cover all areas. Emissions from energy conversion, for example, are not included.
