The indicator shows the number of foods in Berlin school catering that must be sourced exclusively from fair trade. The products rice, bananas and pineapple are to be used only from fair trade since August 2020. 
The commitment is the result of a bidder dialog on socially sustainable procurement in Berlin school catering. Here, the Berlin districts, with the support of the Romero e. V. initiative, have campaigned for fairer school catering.
