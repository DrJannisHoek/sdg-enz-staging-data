The indicator shows the number of racist, antiziganist, anti-Muslim, anti-Black, anti-Semitic, extreme right-wing, anti-LGBTIQ*, anti-disability, social chauvinist and anti-feminist incidents per year in Treptow-Köpenick. <br>
The data comes from the Treptow-Köpenick register. Registers are documentations of discriminatory incidents that occur in Berlin's districts. These incidents are reported by citizens to various contact points, which are distributed throughout the districts, and forwarded to the coordinating offices of the registers. There they are collected, evaluated and published.
