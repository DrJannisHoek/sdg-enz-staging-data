'Registers' are documentations of racist, anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTIQ*, antiziganistic, extreme right-wing, anti-Muslim, anti-Black, anti-Nazi, anti-disability, and social-chauvinist incidents that occur in Berlin's boroughs. These incidents are reported by citizens to various contact points distributed throughout the districts and forwarded to the coordination offices of the registers. There they are collected, evaluated and published.
