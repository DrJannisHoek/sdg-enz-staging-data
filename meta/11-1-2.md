The indicator shows the number of cargo bikes that can be borrowed free of charge through the ADFC project "fLotte" in the district of Treptow-Köpenick. 
Some of the cargo bikes are provided by citizens, businesses and other committed individuals. Another part is provided by the 
program "fLotte kommunal" with funds from the Berlin Senate and the district offices.
