The indicator shows the number of free rentals of cargo bikes by the ADFC project "fLotte" in the district Treptow-Köpenick. 
Some of the cargo bikes are provided by citizens, businesses and other committed individuals. Another part is financed by the program "fLotte kommunal" with funds from the Berlin Senate and the district offices. The Treptow-Köpenick district office has been participating in the "fLotte kommunal" program since March 2020.
