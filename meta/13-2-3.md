The indicator shows the length of the bicycle highways in the district. 
Bicycle highways run as directly as possible and without intermediate stops. They are on average four meters wide, separated from footpaths, well lit and built with high-quality pavement. There are currently no high-speed bicycle highways in the district, but they are being planned.
