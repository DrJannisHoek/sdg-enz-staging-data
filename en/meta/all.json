The data basis for the air pollution of the planning areas (PLR) are the annual mean values 2009 of the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Both values were collected on the basis of 500 by 500 meter grid cells on the one hand and as linear information on main road sections on the other hand. From these data, area-weighted annual mean values for PM2.5 and NO2 were determined for each PLR. Subsequently, the determined values were divided into three categories (low, medium, high). The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact, the top 20 percent high impact, and all others medium impact.\nThe result: Air pollution in Berlin increases from the periphery to the center. For PM2.5, the values in the least polluted PLR were 14.8 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 and in the most polluted PLR 18.4 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the benchmark value of 10 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was exceeded in all PLRs in Berlin. For NO2, the values ranged from 11.3 to 27.3 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the WHO guideline value of 40 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was not exceeded.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/b84d6acb272adb24bed7007d0460b73a047bb0d0","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/d05ccce0afc73d44335d622654aea7f60c7c947a","indicator":"3.3.1","target_id":"3.3","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-03-01"},"13-3-3":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":null,"goal_meta_link_text":null,"graph_title":null,"graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"13.3.3","indicator_definition":null,"indicator_name":"Manufacturing, mining, quarrying","indicator_sort_order":"13-03-03","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"13","target_name":"SDG indicator - CO2 emissions from primary energy consumption (source balance) in Berlin 1990 to 2017 by emitter sector","target_id":"13.3","un_custodian_agency":null,"un_designated_tier":null,"page_content":"","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-08: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/4d80e91dbb745f44acbc974ba82e60130b500e18","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-08: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/4a68e3fa145ab0a2f0d49f8a0ad87c25c783fe66","indicator":"13.3.3"},"7-2-2":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":null,"goal_meta_link_text":null,"graph_title":"Electricity generation on district-owned buildings (kWh/year)","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"7.2.2","indicator_definition":null,"indicator_name":"Electricity generation on district-owned buildings (kWh/year)","indicator_sort_order":"07-02-02","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"7","target_name":"Measure - Energy production on district-owned roofs","target_id":"7.1","un_custodian_agency":null,"un_designated_tier":null,"page_content":"","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/e36b5b5102d00d17b459fb3554b8483dd174f097","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-12: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/3fadda72d1ef4286f1a26851e8c7637c8bb8e0b4","indicator":"7.2.2"},"15-4-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 456kB)","graph_title":"Nature reserves and protected landscape areas (area in ha)","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"15.4.1","indicator_name":"Nature reserves and protected landscape areas (area in ha)","indicator_sort_order":"15-04-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"15","target_name":"SDG indicator - Nature conservation areas","target_id":"15.4","un_custodian_agency":"UNEP-WCMC,UNEP","un_designated_tier":"1","page_content":"","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-15: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/9150987f06d4a0b87c910555ce90e7dc8f0f530b","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-15: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/9150987f06d4a0b87c910555ce90e7dc8f0f530b","indicator":"15.4.1"},"16-1-1-a":{"data_non_statistical":false,"indicator_name":"Number of right-wing extremist and discriminatory incidents","indicator_number":"16.1.1.a","reporting_status":"complete","graph_title":"Recording of right-wing extremist and discriminatory incidents in Treptow K\u00f6penick","graph_type":"line","national_geographical_coverage":"Treptow-K\u00f6penick","computation_units":"Absolute numbers","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Register zur Erfassung rechtsextremer und diskriminierender Vorf\u00e4lle in Berlin, Treptow-K\u00f6penick","source_url_1":"https://berliner-register.de/artikel/treptow-k%C3%B6penick/auswertung-2020-f%C3%BCr-treptow-k%C3%B6penick/22476","published":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","page_content":"'Registers' are documentations of racist, anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTIQ*, antiziganistic, extreme right-wing, anti-Muslim, anti-Black, anti-Nazi, anti-disability, and social-chauvinist incidents that occur in Berlin's boroughs.

Since the areas have different densities, the traffic noise exposure per capita was determined and monetized at external noise costs per person.\nThe noise costs financially represent the loss of benefit that residents experience. The cost rates for this were provided by the Methodology Convention 2.0 of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt). According to these noise costs per capita, the 447 PLRs were sorted in ascending order and divided into three categories: The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact, the top 20 percent high impact, and all others medium impact.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/e3661ec21ff00f3320dc9f7cb4a573ca27af4715","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/1351632fe12c0a9137a3674abeee63d846d6b2b1","indicator":"3.2.1","target_id":"3.2","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-02-01"},"4-1-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-04-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","graph_title":"Number of schools participating in learning conferences per year","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"4.1.1","indicator_name":"Number of schools participating in learning conferences per year","indicator_sort_order":"04-01-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"4","target_name":"Measure -
