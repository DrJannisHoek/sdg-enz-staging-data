Since the areas have different densities, the traffic noise exposure per capita was determined and monetized at external noise costs per person.\nThe noise costs financially represent the loss of benefit that residents experience. The cost rates for this were provided by the Methodology Convention 2.0 of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt). According to these noise costs per capita, the 447 PLRs were sorted in ascending order and divided into three categories: The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact, the top 20 percent high impact, and all others medium impact.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-05-07: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/7716cf65b55428c8b10057b461ea75aa1b3c6dc6","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-05-07: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/4408c760931c588e70dfc92f14d6750054c7e5ec","indicator":"3.3.1.a","target_id":"3.3","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-03-01-0a"}
